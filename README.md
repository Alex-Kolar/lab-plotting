# Lab Plotting Scripts

This repo contains various scripts I have used for creating plots in the lab. This includes both plotting of data and some fitting using the `lmfit` and `scipy` packages.

NOTE: there may be allowances for data reading from different oscilloscopes/instruments, plotting parameters, etc. Please double check the code before using output results.
